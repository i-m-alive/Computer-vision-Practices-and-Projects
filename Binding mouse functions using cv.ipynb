    "Here are some common action functions you can call after these events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Display information**: You can create a function to display information based on the location where the double-click event occurred. For example, you can display pixel values, coordinates, or any other relevant information about the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image manipulation**: You can define functions to manipulate the image based on the double-click event. For instance, you might implement functions to draw shapes, apply filters, crop regions, or perform any other image processing operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Object selection**: If you're working with object detection or segmentation tasks, you can create functions to select or annotate objects in the image when a double-click event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interactive features**: You can implement interactive features such as zooming, panning, or rotating the image based on the double-click event.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Region of Interest (ROI) selection**: Double-click events can be used to define regions of interest (ROIs) within the image. You can create functions to extract or analyze these ROIs further.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **GUI interaction**: If you have a graphical user interface (GUI) built using OpenCV, you can define functions to interact with GUI elements based on double-click events.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of action functions you can call after handling double-click events in OpenCV. The specific actions will depend on your application requirements and the functionality you want to implement. You can define custom functions to perform any desired action based on the detected events."
